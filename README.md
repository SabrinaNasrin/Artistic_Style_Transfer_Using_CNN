# Artistic_Style_Transfer_Using_CNN
### MM805 - Final Project
#### Date: April 27, 2022

This project is done as a part of the MM-805 course.

##### Files:
* [sanet.py](https://github.com/SabrinaNasrin/Artistic_Style_Transfer_Using_CNN/blob/main/sanet.py)
* [SANet_training.py](https://github.com/SabrinaNasrin/Artistic_Style_Transfer_Using_CNN/blob/main/SANet_training.ipynb)
* Input folder containing content images
* Style folder containing the style images
* Output folders are also added for different models

##### IDE:
* Google Colab Pro

##### Language:
* Python 3.9

##### Dependencies:
Install the following libraries in the system:
* OS
* Torch
* TorchVision
* PIL
* argparse
* Kaggle
* TensorboardX
* tqdm


##### How to run the code:
* Download the repository
* Open Google Colab
* Keep all the files in the repository in the same folder
* Download the pretrained models
* Change the location of style image, content image, pretrained models and the output directory
* run [sanet.py](https://github.com/SabrinaNasrin/Artistic_Style_Transfer_Using_CNN/blob/main/sanet.py)

##### How to train the model:
* run the [SANet_training.py](https://github.com/SabrinaNasrin/Artistic_Style_Transfer_Using_CNN/blob/main/SANet_training.ipynb)
* download the dataset as per notebook from kaggle and dependencies
* change the location of the datasets in the main code of training

##### How to measure LPIPS distance
```pip install lpips```
```
!git clone https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity
%cd PerceptualSimilarity
```
```
!python lpips_2imgs.py -p0 /content/drive/MyDrive/SANET-master/input_new/golden_gate.jpg   -p1 /content/drive/MyDrive/avatarnet/golden_gate.jpg --use_gpu
```
